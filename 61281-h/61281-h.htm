<h3>ACT I</h3>


<blockquote>

<p><i>The atrium in the imperial palace on the Palatine Hill. A splendid and
even gorgeous apartment, perhaps fifty feet long and twenty broad. The
spectator views it from one side, and one of the longitudinal walls
thus constitutes the background. At the left of the spectator is the
arched doorway that leads into the ostium, or entrance hallway. At
the right are two doors giving into the peristyle, or garden. In the
back are doors opening upon various apartments, among them, a small
triclinium or banquet-room.</i></p>

<p><i>The atrium has walls of Cipilino marble, and there are ornate pillars
supporting each door-frame. In the centre of the floor is a small
pool, perhaps six by eight feet, and flush with the floor. Above
it, in the ceiling, is a skylight with movable bronze sashes, and
gaudy silk blinds beneath. Despite the architectural magnificence of
the apartment, its furniture, to modern eyes, seems meagre. To the
spectator's right, between the garden doors, there is a solium&mdash;a high,
stiff, ungainly chair, very wide, and upholstered in imperial purple,
i.e., a colour rather like the crimson of today. In front of the solium
stands a very ornate mensa, or table, with a few backless stools.
There is nothing more. Light is furnished by Roman lamps</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> <i>on very tall
candelabra. The moon filters through the skylight.</i></p>

<p><i>It is the night before New Year's Day of the year</i> 221 <span class="sm">A.D.</span></p>

<p><i>As the curtain rises</i>, <span class="sm">HELIOGABALUS'</span> <i>atriensis, or
major-domo</i>, <span class="sm">RUFINIUS</span> <i>by name, ushers in the two physicians</i>,
<span class="sm">PISO</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sm">POLORUS</span>. <span class="sm">RUFINIUS</span> <i>is a stout
Gaul with a full red beard. He wears, of course, no toga, but there are
chevrons of imperial purple on the short left sleeve of his tunic.</i>
<span class="sm">PISO</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sm">POLORUS</span> <i>wear the paenula&mdash;a long, plain
cape, with a hood not unlike a monk's cowl</i>. <span class="sm">PISO'S</span> <i>paenula
is black, but</i> <span class="sm">POLORUS'</span> <i>shows the florid colours of a modern
bathrobe</i>. <span class="sm">PISO</span> <i>is an old man and wears a long white beard</i>;
<span class="sm">POLORUS</span> <i>is younger and wears his clipped, almost in the Van
Dyke manner</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sm">RUFINIUS</span>, <i>as soon as the two doctors have come to anchor by
the pool, offers them a salver on which stand two goblets of wine and a
dish of peanuts</i>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="center p2">RUFINIUS</p>

<p>The Emperor will be out presently. The banquet is just ending.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>From within comes the sound of half-hearted mirth.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>[<i>Reaching for one of the goblets</i>] Very thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>ful of you, Rufinius:
I need it. I was up all night with a confinement case.</p>

<p class="center p2">POLORUS</p>

<p>[<i>Somewhat sniffishly</i>] Yes, my dear Doctor Piso, they are very
tiresome. I'm glad I've been able to give them up.</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>[<i>Waspishly</i>] Give them up? <i>I</i>, Doctor Polorus, I <i>never</i> give them
up! I pull them through.</p>

<p class="center p2">POLORUS</p>

<p>[<i>Rather floored; apologetically</i>] I don't mean patients; I mean cases.</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>[<i>Put into good humour by the success of his repartee</i>] But <i>I</i> mean
neither patients nor cases; I mean husbands.</p>

<p class="center p2">POLORUS</p>

<p>[<i>Amiably, trying to make peace</i>] I suppose he was drunk, as usual.</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>Drunk? His very tears smelt like toddy. You could scarcely call him a
husband in alcohol. He was an alcoholic <i>extract</i> of husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">POLORUS</p>

<p>It's astounding how much they get down when such things are going on in
the house.</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>Yes, and the tighter they get, the more they want to kiss the baby. And
if you let them do it, then you have two cases of delirium tremens on
your hands&mdash;father and child. And the mother raising hell.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Sounds of feeble, somewhat laborious mirth come from the
banquet-room</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p class="center p2">POLORUS</p>

<p>What do you think of&mdash;? [<i>Nodding toward the banquet-room</i>]</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="sm">PISO</span> <i>takes a handful of peanuts and munches them during
the following, now and then biting into a bad one and spitting it
into the pool</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>What is <i>your</i> idea?</p>

<p class="center p2">POLORUS</p>

<p>It looks simple. I say diabetes.</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="center p2">POLORUS</p>

<p>Well, for one thing, he's always so thirsty. Then, his legs are
beginning to trouble him. Thirdly&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>Nonsense! He was born with that thirst. As for his legs, they are
simply overworked. The human leg was designed to carry a man, and
nothing more. Add his clothes, his conscience, his artillery, and his
jewelry, and then pile on a barrel of wine or so every day, and it
begins to lose confidence in itself.</p>

<p class="center p2">POLORUS</p>

<p>The Empress Paula tells me&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>Yes, I know all about the patent medicines he's swallowed and the
quacks he's had here. There was that Syrian, for instance. He
prescribed water-drinking.</p>

<p class="center p2">POLORUS</p>

<p>She says he couldn't keep it on his stomach.</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>No wonder! I daresay his stomach wondered what it was.</p>

<p class="center p2">POLORUS</p>

<p>What do you think of proposing?</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>Nothing could be simpler. If this were an ordinary man, say you or
that fat poinsettia over there, [<i>indicating</i> <span class="sm">RUFINIUS</span>] I'd
simply put him to bed, give him a good big dose of castor oil, and then
send in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> my bill. Maybe I'd add a mustard plaster, and a gargle in the
morning. The next day, repeat the dose. And so on.</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>[<i>Uneasily</i>] But surely you're not going to&mdash;?</p>

<p class="center p2">POLORUS</p>

<p>[<i>Horrified</i>] What! Prescribe castor oil for an emperor? The gods
forbid! Where are your professional ethics? Besides, I've been in jail,
and don't like it. And when I think of lions in the arena gumming this
old epidermis&mdash;!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="sm">PAULA</span> <i>enters from the peristyle, and the two physicians,
catching sight of her at once, make low bows</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p class="center p2">PISO AND POLORUS</p>

<p>Majesty!</p>

<p class="center p2">PAULA</p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="sm">PISO</span>, <i>gushingly</i>] Oh, doctor, I am so glad to see you!
I have been <i>so</i> worried!</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>[<i>In his best manner</i>] Be calm! This&mdash;[<i>indicating</i> <span class="sm">POLORUS</span>]
is Dr. Polorus, my&mdash;[<i>maliciously</i>] assistant. Doctor, you are honoured
by the notice of the Empress Paula.</p>

<p class="center p2">PAULA</p>

<p>[<i>Buttonholing</i> <span class="sm">PISO</span> <i>tragically</i>] I surely hope you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
gentlemen can do something for the poor Emperor. You can't imagine what
I have gone through. I think he's getting worse all the time. And those
awful quacks he has had!</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>Yes, I have heard. It's common gossip.</p>

<p class="center p2">PAULA</p>

<p>One of them put him on water! Like a horse! [<i>It gradually becomes
evident that</i> <span class="sm">PAULA</span>, <i>who is about 37 and rather chunky, is
somewhat alcoholized and inclined to weep</i>] I thought he would die the
first night. I was up the whole night. I wouldn't let any of the other
ladies touch him. I suffered terribly.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Succumbing to the martyr complex, she sobs boozily on</i>
<span class="sm">PISO'S</span> <i>shoulder</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>[<i>With professional tact</i>] And what seemed to be the symptoms?</p>

<p class="center p2">PAULA</p>

<p>Just grief, I guess. The love of a pure woman. I still feel very faint.</p>

<p class="center p2">POLORUS</p>

<p>Perhaps a goblet of wine&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">PAULA</p>

<p>[<i>Promptly motioning to</i> <span class="sm">RUFINIUS</span>] And you, too.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> Pardon me
for forgetting. I am all worn out. You doctors have to be up all night,
and&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>[<i>Reaching for his goblet</i>] People simply <i>will</i> send for one. I seldom
get out of my clothes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The three drink</i>]</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="center p2">POLORUS</p>

<p>And you were saying that the Emperor&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">PAULA</p>

<p>Doctor, you'd hardly believe it. He's so changed I hardly know
him&mdash;always complaining about his stomach-aches, and taking pills
and things. You know how lively he used to be&mdash;always up to some
pleasantry. Why, even when we had a quiet dinner here at home&mdash;just
him and me and the other girls&mdash;he'd have in one of those dancers from
Mesopotamia, and make him dance on a red-hot stove. Always something
jolly. And how he would laugh and cut up! But now look at him! Even
this New Year's Eve banquet is like a funeral. Think of it! He
wouldn't let me go to it&mdash;and I've been sitting beside him at banquets
for&mdash;well, ever since I was almost a child. And all the other girls
barred out, too&mdash;all except Dacia.</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>[<i>Professionally</i>] Too bad, too bad!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">PAULA</p>

<p>I say nothing against Dacia&mdash;not a word. She is a very nice girl. I
was glad to see him marry her&mdash;that is, if he had to marry anybody. I
thought he had wives enough. You can imagine what trouble it makes for
<i>me</i>. But you don't want to hear <i>my</i> afflictions.</p>

<p class="center p2">POLORUS</p>

<p>Your Majesty was saying that the Emperor is depressed.</p>

<p class="center p2">PAULA</p>

<p>Depressed? You'd think he had on damp underclothes! And he keeps on
sending for those quacks&mdash;even those crazy dervishes and religious
healers from Asia.</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>Religion? Aha! Mental symptoms!</p>

<p class="center p2">PAULA</p>

<p>Why, yesterday I hear he actually had in one of those awful
Jews&mdash;Christians, some of them now call themselves&mdash;the kind they burn
at the circus.</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>Riff-raff! They actually say they can cure a sick man without medicine.
[<i>To</i> <span class="sm">POLORUS</span>] Your pardon, Doctor.</p>

<p class="center p2">POLORUS</p>

<p>No offence at all, I assure you. My family is from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> Spain&mdash;Mendoza was
the family name. I loathe these kikes as much as you do.</p>

<p class="center p2">PAULA</p>

<p>[<i>Continuing</i>] So I sent for you doctors. I hear you do wonders. But
you must be careful. No feeling of pulses or sticking out of tongues.
Just say you have heard he is feeling poorly, and have dropped in as a
matter of patriotism. Don't tell him I sent for you. He'll be here in a
few moments, as soon as the <i>banquet</i> [<i>she sniffs sarcastically</i>] is
over. You'll see how sick he is the moment he comes in.</p>

<p class="center p2">POLORUS</p>

<p>And as for the symptoms, Majesty: you say he complains of&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>His speech is cut short by the entrance of a guest who comes from
the triclinium supported by two slaves. He is very drunk and they
drop him beside the pool and proceed to bathe his face</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p class="center p2">PAULA</p>

<p>Oh, the poor man! Something has disagreed with him.</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>Who is the gentleman?</p>

<p class="center p2">PAULA</p>

<p>I don't know him. I think he is one of the generals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> from the colonies.
[<i>To one of the slaves</i>] Who is he?</p>

<p class="center p2">THE SLAVE</p>

<p>Caius Macrinus, Majesty. Commander of the Western Fleet.</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>Ah, a naval officer! [<i>To the slave</i>] Is he taken this way often?</p>

<p class="center p2">THE SLAVE</p>

<p>[<i>Idiotically</i>] Only when he drinks.</p>

<p class="center p2">POLORUS</p>

<p>I think it may be fits. Let's take a look at him.</p>

<p class="center p2">PAULA</p>

<p>Shall I order some wine?</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>No. That is, not for the patient.</p>

get excited about it? Why stir up those poor country yokels at the
market, and give the policemen trouble?</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>I came to preach the Word. I came to bring peace. Aye, even peace to
you, Cæsar;&mdash;with the sin and blood upon your hands.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>[<i>To the clerk</i>] Mr. Clerk, the defendant is in the shadow. Can't we
move the lamps a bit?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The clerk moves them experimentally</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>So; an inch or so to the left. That's better. [<i>To</i> <span class="sm">LUCIA</span>] And
now, my dear, about this blood upon my hands. Surely you have confused
me with some one else. I am never violent.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>It was by your decree that they died&mdash;burned alive, torn to pieces by
wild beasts, butchered by gladiators&mdash;five hundred souls.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Oh-h, you mean those&mdash;what do you call them?&mdash;Christians! Well, surely
you are not complaining of that. All <i>that</i> is a mere matter of
administrative routine. They practise magic; they claim to be able to
heal the sick, even to raise the dead. The law is the law.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>It is their faith that gives life; it is their faith that heals. And
that faith [<i>touching her heart</i>] is here.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>[<i>To the clerk</i>] I'll have to trouble you about the lights again. Bring
that big lamp nearer to the prisoner. The rest of you stand back.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The clerk so places the light that</i> <span class="sm">LUCIA'S</span> <i>face is in
the full glare of it</i>. <span class="sm">HELIOGABALUS</span> <i>views her with obvious
and prolonged admiration</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Thank you; now I can <i>hear</i> her better. [<i>To</i> <span class="sm">LUCIA</span>] And you
were saying, my dear?</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>[<i>Striking her heart again</i>] My faith is here. The truth is here. The
power of the spirit is here.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Yes, so far, so good. But surely you don't claim to be a magician like
those other Christians. A pretty girl like you!</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>There is no magic! There is only the spirit.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>But, my dear! What has the spirit to do with the belly-ache? How can
the spirit help a man when he is doubled up? What could it do for <i>me</i>?</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>Even you, Cæsar. Even <i>you</i> are not beyond the grace of the Lord.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>[<i>Growing more interested</i>] Do you mean to say that I can be cured by
this new magic, this so-called Christianity?</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>By Christianity, Cæsar, and by the spirit within. Even <i>you</i> may be
healed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Do you mean without swallowing any more pills?</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>I know nothing of pills. I know only the work of the Lord.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>But what I am getting at is: what is the <i>machinery</i> of it? How do you
set the Lord to <i>working</i>? Just how do you do it?</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>[<i>Simply</i>] We pray.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Is <i>that</i> all?</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>We lay on hands.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>[<i>Vastly interested</i>] So! You lay on hands? And do you yourself&mdash;that
is to say, are you yourself a practitioner of this&mdash;this&mdash;laying on of
hands?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He leans over to glance cautiously at the door through which</i>
<span class="sm">DACIA</span> <i>has gone</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>My prayers have been answered. I take no reward. I would ask the Lord's
mercies even for you, Cæsar.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Well, all I have to say is that you are a very nice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> girl. First you
accuse me of murdering your friends, and now you say you are willing to
pray for me,&mdash;and even to lay on hands.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>It is the command: forgive those who have ill-used you.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Oh, I say: now you are going too far. Imagine <i>me</i> ill-using <i>you</i>.
Sweet piece, you <i>wrong</i> me.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>[<i>In surprise</i>] I am not to be burned?</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>The idea! Burn <i>you</i>! The very thought of it revolts me. You have been
misinformed, my dear. I am a very humane man&mdash;even a polite man.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>But&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Yes, I know what you are going to say. Now and then I am irritable&mdash;and
maybe order a man or two, or a dozen or so, to the&mdash;that is, now
and then, I let the law take its course. But when a man is in bad
health&mdash;and always has the stomach-ache&mdash;he sometimes gets out of
humour. Who wouldn't? You have no idea how much I have suffered, and
what awful medicines I have taken. Not half an hour ago I had to have
another of those quacks ducked in this very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> room. Well, the Christians
have this easy cure&mdash;this way of curing by laying on hands&mdash;and yet
they let me suffer. Is it any wonder that I sometimes lose my temper?
Now you say that <i>you</i> also know the trick, and I was wondering&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>I shall pray for you, Cæsar.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Yes, by all means. But this laying on of hands&mdash;I have a notion that it
might, er&mdash;fit my particular case even better.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>[<i>Diffidently</i>] We could try.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>So we could. But not here. I have a feeling that a crowd might
be&mdash;well, unsympathetic. [<i>To the clerk</i>] The court recesses, Mr.
Clerk. Clear the room!</p>

is too much. I've tried to be a good chief wife to the Emperor. Have
you ever heard me complain when he came home with a girl and&mdash;sent for
the musicians? Never! But I'm getting tired of this <i>marrying</i>. When
he marries another one <i>I</i> have her on my hands. Who has to keep order
among them? Who protects them when he gets into a bad humour and begins

<p class="center p2">RUFINIUS</p>

<p>Oh, Majesty, Majesty!</p>

<p class="center p2">PAULA</p>

<p>Rufinius is innocent. I drank the wine&mdash;all of it!</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>I believe you&mdash;but nevertheless, Rufinius <i>lied</i> to me. Can I afford to
let it get about that it is safe to lie to the Emperor of Rome? Surely
not. Now, go to bed and get a good night's rest and let me attend to
Rufinius' ear. He is tired of waiting. The longer we put off the matter
of his ear, the longer it will take to heal.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>But you have a wife already.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>[<i>Horrified</i>] What! Eleven!</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Eleven living. My poor, dear Marcia is dead&mdash;among others. Paula
succeeded her. Dynastic reasons, my juicy plum: the merit system was
unheard of in those days. Then there is Annia Faustina, with the red
hair. And Cælestis. I married her in Gaul: I was very lonely. And then
there is Aquilia Severa. And Falia. And dear little Dacia. That was
Dacia who was with me when those scoundrels brought you in. You will
like Dacia&mdash;that is, you <i>would</i> like her if you knew her. And then
there is Gestina. And&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He hesitates</i>]</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>That makes seven.</p>

<p>And Blenina, the blonde. And Alinia. And&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>That makes nine.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Well, let so much be considered the reading of the minutes. It would
only bore you to go on. Besides, why do it? Put them beside <i>you</i>, my
new baby&mdash;oh, my! You saw one of them&mdash;Paula. Imagine a cultivated man,
a man of artistic tastes, swapping a real kiss with&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>But the Lord forbids. A man must cleave to one wife.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>A sensible idea. In fact, a capital idea. If the rest of Christianity
is like that, put down my name at once. But it's too late.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>You have married all these women?</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Every one of them, so far as I can make out. Including Paula.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>Then you have broken the law of the Lord. Then you have sinned.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>[<i>Snuggling close</i>] Oh, come now. Surely it is no sin to marry. I
always thought that&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>Marriage is of the Lord.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Well, then, how do you make it out that I have sinned? If it's all
right to marry one wife, why should it be a sin to marry another wife?</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>You are mocking me, Cæsar.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Not at all, I assure you. I am quite serious. Just <i>why</i> should it be a
sin, as you call it, to marry more than one?</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>There are many reasons, Cæsar. The Lord has spoken. A man, in His eyes,
can truly love but one woman.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Fiddlesticks, little prune cake. I have eleven wives, and I love no
less than <i>four</i> of them.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p><i>Love</i> them?</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Well, more or less. At all events, I <i>did</i> love them. Now&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>You loved them <i>truly</i>?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>One of them for <i>two</i> long years!</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>But marriage must endure unto death.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>It did. It wasn't <i>my</i> fault. But figure it for yourself: When I caught
her with that gladiator, what could I do? It was a great shock to me.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>You&mdash;?</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>It cut me to the heart. I almost felt like taking some of the poison
myself.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>[<i>Horrified</i>] You had her poisoned?</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>What was I to do? I went as far as I decently could. I invited the
gladiator to dinner. They died in each other's arms. I even buried him
at my own expense.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>You are horrible.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>I am a husband.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>And you? Isn't a Christian an infidel? You, too, are an infidel&mdash;but
[<i>sentimentally</i>]&mdash;a very dear, sweet little infidel. Now, how about
another of those Christian kisses&mdash;but this time a man's size one?</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>[<i>Not heeding him</i>] Could you share your love&mdash;or what you call your
love&mdash;for me with any other woman?</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>[<i>Insistent</i>] Could you?</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Well, I'm no longer as young as I used to be.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>Could you?</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Turn your head a bit, so that the light falls on your hair. Ah, the

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>What! Right away!</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Don't be afraid of crowding them. I could stand millions of those

spectator, with its back against the back wall and its foot facing
the footlights. Beside it, separated by a space of no more than
two feet, is the huge bed of his wives. It is, in design, exactly
like his own, but it is at least 20 feet wide. The bed-clothing
stretches unbrokenly from side to side of it, but there are separate
pillows&mdash;twelve of them, each embroidered with a large monogram in
purple. The pillow with the "L"</i> [<i>for</i> <span class="sm">LUCIA</span>] <i>is nearest</i>
<span class="sm">HELIOGABALUS'</span> <i>bed. In the narrow space between this huge
bed and</i> <span class="sm">HELIOGABALUS'</span> <i>there is a small night table,
and on it are a lamp and a bottle of water and goblet. This lamp
furnishes the only light in</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span> <i>the room. Twelve clothes-racks, piled
with finery, are at the extreme right.</i></p>

<p><i>As the curtain rises</i>, <span class="sm">HELIOGABALUS</span> <i>is propped up in bed,
reading a scroll by the light of the lamp</i>. <span class="sm">LUCIA</span> <i>is the

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>[<i>Somewhat uncertainly</i>] Who wrote it?</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>One of your Christian poets&mdash;Commodianus. What you call a hymn writer.
It sickens me.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>[<i>Challengingly</i>] I like it.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Yes, and you also like the Song of Solomon. I blush for you, little
sweetbread. The Song of Solomon is pretty raw stuff. It is astonishing
what a few months of marriage will do to an otherwise modest girl.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>[<i>Primly</i>] Solomon sang of Paradise.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Oh, did he? But he took good care to fill Paradise with cuties. He had
the imagination of a sailor. If Paradise is actually full of that sort
of thing&mdash;if such didoes go on there&mdash;then all I can say is that&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>Now don't start moralizing, Cæsar.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Why not? I am moral: why shouldn't I moralize? Is it a crime for a cow
to give milk?</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>[<i>An exclamation of disgust</i>] Oh, you always&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>I have been faithful to you, little pullet, for 180 days and, what's
more, 180 <i>nights</i>. How's that for morals? I defy you to find me a
Christian to match it, at any weight. Think of it! Here am I, still in
the prime of life, Emperor of Rome, Pontifex Maximus and all the rest
of it, and yet I am as virtuous as a convict in the death-house. Here
am I without a glass of schnapps for six months. Here am I with twelve
wives, at least five of them charming, and I lock eleven of them out,
and&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>You must obey the Word.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Well, I have obeyed it. And what do I get for it? I still have my
stomach-ache. And the one wife I have left rolls over about half a
mile, and leaves me to shiver over bad poetry. [<i>He throws the scroll
on the floor</i>] My dear, you must allow something to my training. I am
used to society at night. Loneliness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> always starts up my dyspepsia.
How many times have I suddenly wakened and cast my eye over that bed
and watched the sweet girls as they slumbered, or whispered to one
another, or nudged one another, or giggled in their more or less
perfect innocence. There was always at least <i>one</i> awake. And when she
saw me sitting up wearily, tortured by some business of state, she
would crawl over and pour me out a drink of the real stuff, and then
snuggle into bed with me, and stroke my hair, and&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>There was always an Eye upon you. There was One who saw.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Well, if there was, then I call it damned bad form. Even the gods
should have <i>some</i> decency.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>[<i>Horrified</i>] Decency?</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Well, then, say good manners.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>Now you blaspheme, Cæsar. You should pray.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>I am willing. I have no objection to prayer&mdash;in its proper place. As
you may recall, I was originally designed for the church: it was only
accident that threw me into politics. But your proposal, now&mdash;your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
scheme of praying <i>here</i> every evening&mdash;isn't it a bit vulgar?</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>What an idea!</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Still, I can't rid myself of it. It haunts my conscience, so to speak.
Just think of it a moment. Imagine praying in a&mdash;<i>bed</i>room! Don't you
get a vague flavour of, say, impropriety? Isn't it a trifle&mdash;indelicate?</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>I think you are talking nonsense.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>[<i>Reaching for the water-jug and pouring out another goblet</i>] Maybe
I am. [<i>He takes a swallow, chokes and spits it out</i>] But isn't that
precisely what a man seeks in marriage&mdash;a sort of virtuous nonsense?
You forget the way I make a living, my cold little rabbit. My days are
filled with gloomy duties. If I didn't look solemn as an owl the people
would lose confidence in me. Say I go to the circus. There are twenty
Jews in the arena, and the guards let out the lions. One Jew tries to
climb up another Jew. Imagine the fun!</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>How you talk!</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>[<i>Rubbing his stomach, as if feeling a pain</i>]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> Nevertheless, it is
actual fun, genuine humour&mdash;and I naturally want to squat on my little
rearo, throw back my ears and yell. But I am the Emperor, and so I must
keep my dignity. Every one else whoops and bawls, but if I go further
than a snicker then it begins to be talked of in the barber-shops,
and people say that I am drinking too much. [<i>He casts a self-pitying
glance at the water-bottle</i>] Even as it is, a good many of them think
that I am somewhat&mdash;flightier&mdash;than I ought to be. For example,
consider my interest in you&mdash;especially my interest in your faith&mdash;this
so-called Christianity of yours. Well, to <i>you</i> it may be serious
enough, but think how it must appear to the average respectable Roman.
<i>He</i> regards it as simply pishposh&mdash;and he thinks of <i>me</i> much as he
would think of me if he heard that I was interested in some sort of
idiotic Egyptian sorcery.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>[<i>Primly</i>] I see no possible connection.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Naturally not, little canary. You are not a Roman. Well, neither
am I. I was born in Syria. I am hyphenated. But now to get to my
point. First, my business all day is solemn; secondly, these little
theological debates of ours in the evening are solemn. So you see what
is the matter. I lack recreation. I lack&mdash;well, there is nothing to
distract and mellow my mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>[<i>With a touch of sarcasm</i>] Well, what do you suggest?</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>[<i>Brightening</i>] I suggest, first of all, little squash-pie, that you
come over here and give your little papa a great big kiss.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>[<i>Still primly</i>] You had better go to sleep.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>What! At ten o'clock! That's another thing: this ten o'clock business.
Really I&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>It is time.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Yes, it is time for a kiss. Plenty of time&mdash;time for a good, long,
damp, sticky one. [<i>Wheedling, half rising</i>] Now, come on, Lucia! Be
nice!</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>He said he was a heathen, and proud of it. He said his father was a

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>And what did he say to that?</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>He said&mdash;well, he said he had made up his mind to <i>go</i> to hell.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>What have I done <i>now</i>? Mentioned underdrawers! Well, if a man isn't to

talk about them?</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>[<i>Primly</i>] Why talk about them at all?</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Why? Simply because they <i>have</i> to be talked about. [<i>With growing

<p>Now you are exaggerating. They are all quite respectable. My marriage
to every one of them is, as I've told you, sound in Roman law.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>But not in the eye of God. The Scripture says "A bishop shall have but
one wife."</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>But I'm not a bishop.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>Well, surely no one ought to be allowed more wives than a bishop.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Granted. But here they are.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>Turn them away. Read the Word.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>[<i>A bit irritated</i>] Yes, yes; I have read it. The theory is very
lovely. It has affected me greatly; I have adopted it as you know. But
here I have these girls legally on my hands, and surely you wouldn't
ask me to&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>You should be glad to get rid of them. Such a pack of&mdash;of&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Now, now, I must really forbid you. Paula, of course, is open to a
certain criticism, at least æsthetically. And Cælestis is probably no
stunner. But among the others there are certainly a number who&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>[<i>Tearfully</i>] You don't love me in the proper Christian way!</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>What nonsense! I love you to an extreme degree. [<i>He takes up and
kisses her hand</i>] My affection for you is really colossal. But let
us be just. Surely it's absurd to say that <i>all</i> of them are&mdash;well,
offensive. There are surely exceptions.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>[<i>Resolutely</i>] Not one.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Oh, come now. For example, there is Dacia. I haven't seen her for these
long months, but I remember her quite clearly. Surely Dacia has a
certain charm. She is young, she has a good complexion, she sings very
acceptably, and she&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>I see what is the matter. You are homesick for her and her kind. For
her and the old infidel life.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Not at all. I merely remember her. That's all. I merely remember. A
toothsome girl. But a lady. Her father was a philosopher in Athens ...
she wasn't in that crowd. She is naturally affectionate.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>And kissing all the time, I suppose. Never a moment for the things of
the spirit. Always the flesh.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Oh, by no means. I really wouldn't have permitted it. I quite agree
with you there. Such things may be overdone. At my age.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>But you like it, don't you?</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>[<i>Looking at her sharply</i>] Yes&mdash;on occasion. But there is where I agree
with you: that is the precise reason why the thing should be limited.
[<i>A bit wistfully</i>] If one kissed too much, one would be too happy. And
that, of course, wouldn't do at all.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>The happiness of this life is as dust.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>The happiness to come is eternal.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Well, I hope so. But, you see, my trouble is old Paula's. I was brought
up wrong. I suppose it is incurable. I notice, at times, an almost
irresistible lasciviousness&mdash;what you call worldliness. [<i>Amorously</i>]
When I see you there in your nightie I forget all about Christianity
and can hardly resist the temptation to throw my arms around you and
give you a hug. I know it's wrong, but there it is.</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>[<i>Somewhat shaken</i>] Well, I shouldn't call it lasciviousness. And it
isn't exactly wrong.</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>[<i>Ironically</i>] No?</p>

<p class="center p2">LUCIA</p>

<p>The Scriptures say&mdash;</p>

<p>Anyway, I don't seem to get used to this going to bed sober. [<i>He

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Nobly spoken. And much better news! [<i>Half dreamily</i>] But what is this
so-called soul you speak of? Is it a gas? Has it got length, breadth,
thickness? Is the soul in the body, or the body in the soul? When I
used to cut a Christian into two halves, which half was the soul in?
Was <i>it</i> divided too? Well, then, suppose I had him run through a
sausage cutter, and he came out, say, in four million pieces: was the
soul in four million pieces, too? You say that the soul re-enters the
body on the day of judgment. Well, suppose I take two Jews and cut off
their heads, and put the head of A on the body of B, and vice versa.
Does the soul of A go into the body of A or into the head of A, which
is on the body of B? If it goes into the head, is it responsible for
the sins of the body of B? [<i>He reaches over and, slyly watching</i>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>Talk? Talking is my trade, little icicle. Talk is the heart's blood

I have today. He had a smooth and slippery tongue, had Heliogabalus.

Well, they were all willing: my conscience is perfectly clear. As the
lawyers say, <i>Caveat emptor</i>. When a girl has a taste for epigrams
she must be careful: a man of my wit is dangerous. I'll never forget
my poor dear first wife&mdash;good old Marcia. It was an epigram that made
her fall in love with me. I remember the circumstances perfectly. She
was complaining that love was beyond her comprehension&mdash;that it was
ineffable, indescribable, transcendental. "Love," <i>I</i> replied, with
droll perspicacity, "Love," I replied, "is the triumph of imagination
over intelligence."</p>

<p class="center p2">HELIOGABALUS</p>

<p>You interrupt me, cold darling. What I was about to say is that poor
old Marcia laughed so hard she rolled clear out of bed. An old joke&mdash;as
old as the Babylonians. But fact! You should have heard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span> bump when
she landed on her&mdash;[<i>a sidelong glance</i>]&mdash;her upholstery. I had to haul

to a long book! [<i>He pauses and waits for appreciation. No sound comes
from</i> <span class="sm">LUCIA</span>. <i>He goes on in a slightly louder voice</i>] Love
is like war: easy to begin but very hard to stop. [<i>Another inquiring

the corpse remains in the house. [<i>Another</i>] A woman in love is less
modest than a man: she has less to be ashamed of. [<i>A longish pause.

from another. [<span class="sm">LUCIA</span> <i>is still silent. He lifts himself to

has a sense of humour. An intelligent girl, Dacia. And how her nose
puckers when she is a bit&mdash;squiffed. Somehow, I&mdash;[<i>He empties the

<h3>ACT III</h3>


<p><i>The next night.</i></p>

<p><i>A corridor in the palace. It stretches longitudinally across the
stage and is rather narrow. In the wall to the back there is a wide
and high arch, covered with heavy hangings of imperial purple, showing
two large embroidered H's, with wreaths above them, in gold. The solid
wall of the corridor, seen to the two sides of the central hangings,
is of coloured marble. The hangings conceal the state banquet hall,
and the corridor is the emperor's means of getting to the latter from
his private apartments. All decorations are simple, but of the utmost
richness.</i></p>

<p><i>During the whole act, down to the last scene, sounds of revelry come
from the banquet hall&mdash;laughter, music and the clinking of goblets&mdash;now
faintly and now loudly.</i></p>

<p><i>As the curtain rises</i> <span class="sm">PISO</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sm">POLORUS</span> <i>enter,
followed by a slave pushing their rolling table of medicines and
instruments. They are in long white tunics, reaching below the knees,
and with short sleeves&mdash;the early Roman equivalent of modern operating
gowns.</i></p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>[<i>To the slave</i>] Here, Ambrose, shove it to this side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The slave runs the table to the left, halts it by the back wall,
and exits</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p class="center p2">POLORUS</p>

<p>[<i>Officiously</i>] Where is the headache powder?</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>[<i>Reaching to the shelf beneath the table, he brings up a huge blue
bottle</i>] Here you are. Do you think we have enough?</p>

<p class="center p2">POLORUS</p>

<p>It's enough to kill them, but I doubt that it's enough to cure them,
once they get started.</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>Well, if we run out of it, we can give them some cholera mixture.
They'll never know the difference.</p>

<p class="center p2">POLORUS</p>

<p>[<i>Busily arranging the bottles</i>] All this does me good, my boy. It
makes me young again.</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>Do you think the moral movement is really over?</p>

<p class="center p2">POLORUS</p>

<p>If it isn't, then why this good old-fashioned banquet? Why all the old
crowd? Why all the old girls? I suspect that Paula arranged the whole
thing. Have you seen the list of guests?</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">POLORUS</p>

<p>Well, not a tank is missing. Every zinc-lined stomach and copper-plated
kidney in Rome is here. By the way, have we got enough stomach-pumps?</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>[<i>Indicating them</i>] Here are six.</p>

<p class="center p2">POLORUS</p>

<p>Maybe that will be enough. [<i>He roots among the medicines</i>] I have a
feeling that this will finish the Christian wife. She'll never stand
for an old-time banquet.</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>Then let us thank all the gods. If Christianity ever actually got on
its legs, the doctoring business would go to pot. All this praying and
fasting and going to bed at ten o'clock is fatal to pathology. The aim
of medicine is to save a man from the just consequences of his own
vices. If he gives up his vices, then&mdash;</p>

<p class="center p2">POLORUS</p>

<p>But he never does. All he ever comes to is the exchange of one vice for
another. This praying that you mention is a vice. Fasting is a vice.
Going to bed at ten o'clock is a vice.</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>Maybe so. But I am speaking medically. The medicine that <i>we</i> studied
was designed for certain ends. It supposes the existence of certain
vices.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> You and I know, for example, how to treat a man who has eaten
too much or who hasn't had sleep <i>enough</i>. But what of the man who has
fasted, and at the same time got too <i>much</i> sleep? There you stand
medicine on its head. And I am too old to learn it all over again.</p>

<p class="center p2">POLORUS</p>

<p>[<i>Argumentatively</i>] You make imaginary difficulties, Dr. Piso. Simply
give him a dose of salts, say I, and trust to luck. You talk as if a
physician had to <i>cure</i> his patient. Nonsense. All he has to do is to
<i>try</i> to cure him.</p>

<p class="center p2">PISO</p>

<p>So it is. But this is the Emperor's private corridor. You ought to have
gone the other way, through the atrium.</p>

<p class="center p2">CAIUS</p>

<p>Excuse me, gentleman. I apologize. [<i>He attempts a right-about-face</i>]
Which way did you say? I thought I was in the palace. I saw a lot of
cuties going into the basement and so I thought it was the palace.
[<i>Suddenly pulling himself up</i>] But say, Doctor, I knew I wanted to see

corridor. A superb flash of colour. There is a huge horse-shoe of a
table, very low, and it is surrounded by the low couches on which
the Romans reclined at meals. Around the horse-shoe are grouped

the theatre. In the centre of the horse-shoe is a small dancing
floor, and exactly in the middle of it a tall fountain, with
coloured lights playing upon it. The walls of the hall are richly
decorated, and various barbaric banners show brilliant patches of
colour. All the guests are in white togas, but on the shoulder of
every one there is some coloured badge of rank. The musicians are
far to the rear and their music is heard constantly, save when</i>

It's all up. [<i>A wild leaping about</i>] Throw out the reverend and send
for the embalmers. [<i>She leaps into the fountain</i>] The soul takes
flight. [<i>She is now almost naked. The water plays upon her</i>] Nothing
